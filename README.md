Program 1: 
  -Calculates the concentration of exposed hydrophobic residues given values for keq, [A]total, [B]total
  -Creates data for figure 2
  -Inputs: (lines 32, 33; lines 64-66)
      -line 32: g < # kays values
      -line 33: h < # atots values
      -line 64: kays = {given keq values}
      -line 65: atots = {given [A]total}
      -line 66: btots = {given [B]total}

Program 2:
  -Calculates expected distribution of states for subfunctionalization-only model and subfunctionalization + Dosage model after whole-genome duplication
  -Currently written to produce data for figure 3 and 4a

        For each effective population size listed;
            For each generation until desired time point;
                Concentration of hydrophobic residues when in stoichiometric balance ([A]tot=[B]tot) = [A]free + [B]free (calculated from k, [A]total, [B]total);
                Concentration of hydrophobic residues when out of stoichiometric balance ([A]tot=2[B]tot) = [A]free + [B]free (calculated from k, [A]total, [B]total);
                For each state;
                    Unaffected tissues = z â€“ current state;
                    Affected tissues  = current state;
                    Summation of hydrophobic residues across tissues = (unaffected tissues)*concentration hp when in stoichiometric balance + affected tissues * concentration hp when out of stoichiometric balance;
                    Fitness per state = 1/(scalar + sum of hp across tissues for state);
                Vector of fitness values for each state  = [fitness of state 0, fitness of state 1, etc];
                Probability Distribution Across States = using generator Markov matrix with vector of fitness values for each state, and initial state vector;

  -Inputs: (lines 91 - 123)
  -AND change the initial state vector if need be (lines 376-380)

Program 3: 
  -Calculates expected distribution of states for subfunctionalization-only model and subfunctionalization + Dosage model after small-scale duplication. 
  -Currently written to produce data for figure 4b.
  -When calculating  sum of hp across tissues,first calculate [a]free and [b]free in balance and out of balance tissues and sum of [hp] = affected_tissue*hp_per_tissue_in_balance + unaffected_tissue*hp_per_tissue_out_of_balance;
  -and [A]tot and [B]tot is half that of WGD events...
